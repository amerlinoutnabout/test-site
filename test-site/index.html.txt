Amanda Merlin
The Second Act

Hello, I am Amanda. I have been a Speech Language Pathologist and Assistive Technology Specialist for the first part of my professional life, but I have never felt completely happy. 2020 gave me time to really do some soul searching and I have decided that I really want to pursue skills in coding and tech. I loves working as a manager and project manager. I love system analysis and problem solving. I have two cats and an amazing husband. We live in Washington State and love to travel and adventure. During the Summer you can find us backpacking and in the winter we are usually snowshoeing or snowboarding. I have ADHD so my interests and hobbies can change one day to the next! I have been known to enjoy
